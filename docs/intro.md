# Introduction


## What is lux?
Lux is a cross-platform desktop proxy client that is completely open-source. 
It supports both the Windows and macOS operating systems, runs at the network layer, and nearly all functionalities are accomplished through an GUI.


## Motivation

Before launching lux, there are many powerful proxy tools. Why lux?  Lux is designed to address the following issues:

* Hard to use for average person. I know with some tools, you can control more about their network,even block ads. But power means complexity and not every one needs that.
* Not open sourced. For some reason, some of those is close sourced. Of course, it not means harm. However, These still need high priviliage, so it's better to be open sourced.
* Too heavy as a proxy tool.

:::note
Lux is not a replacement of clash and it will not. If you need more powerful features, just use clash.
