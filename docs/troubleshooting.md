# Troubleshooting


### Lux can't keep connected when os goes to sleep.

If lux keep connected, when os wakes up, network will be unavailable on macOS and memory usage will be huge on Windows.
The issue is still under investigation.
So, it's better to disconnect it and reconnect it when os wakes up.




### Lux open the dashboard in browser instead of webview.

Firstly, flutter still does not support webview on desktop officially. And the available webview plugins are not stable.
