# Light Client Mode

Use native UI instead of webview.

## Why?

When Lux was born, web technology is the primary way to build cross-platform applications to me.
However, webview has some limitations, such as:
* High memory usage
* Poor support in Flutter desktop(main problem), see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/99597 and https://github.com/igoogolx/lux/issues/130

Therefore, I decided to build a native UI with components of Flutter. However, it doesn't mean webview is dropped.
Web technology was and will be an important part of Lux.
Actually, Light Client Mode is a hybrid architecture:
* The simple main UI is built with native components 
* Other complex UIs are still built with web technology but opened in browser instead of webview

## How to enable?
Go to **Setting** -> enable **Light Client Mode**. Then restart Lux.
